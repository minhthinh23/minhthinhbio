            <i><b>Group Four Customer Survey</b></i></B></A></i></p>


        <h2>Initial Thoughts:</h2>
            <p>The survey is very simple and easy to use which is great as it seems to be a concensus that long and difficult surveys can be quite boring and tend to have more users quitting the survey without submitting their responses. </p>


        <h2>What was done well:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Great questions were asked which could provide valuable data to the team e.g. <i>"What types of products you want to buy?"</i></li>
                <li>The survey is not overly complex but achieves it's goal, which makes the survey experience better for the participant.</li>
                <li>The questions were unbiased and focused towards the user's <b>past experiences</b> rather than speculations. </li>
            </ul>


        <h2>What could be improved:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>I thought it was great how the survey branched to the Buy, Sell or Services Survey however it would've been nice to be able to fill in multiple branches <i>e.g. 
                    some users may both buy and sell but only had to fill in one survey depending on their prior answer.</i></li>
                <li>The survey was lacking open ended questions which could provide more complex and in depth feedback to the team.</li>
                <li>There was a duplicate question asking for the participant's email address.
                </li>
            </ul>


        <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
            <p>I get the understanding that this survey was intended to find out more information about what purpose the user is using the site for (e.g. buying or selling). The questions were quite clear and easy to follow and very much relavent to the information the team is looking for.</p>
